Easier to write serializations

### Problem

Most serialization formats are harder to write by human.
So far YAML might be the best serialization format to human, 
I wanted something little bit more easier than it.

### Solution

Serializer generates eval-able code which yields object.
So we can use various JS features to create object 
(Class, macro function, etc.)
